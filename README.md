## 🔍 Project Overview

This project proposes an **automated safety system** to reduce **accidents at train stations**, specifically targeting the **gap between trains and platforms**. By using **Arduino**, **proximity sensors**, **servo motors**, **LCD displays**, and **speakers**, the system ensures a safer and more informed boarding experience for passengers.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🚦 **Train Detection:** Proximity sensors detect approaching trains.
- 🦿 **Gap Filling:** Servo motor activates a metal plate to close the train-platform gap.
- 📢 **Auditory Alerts:** A speaker gives warning sounds when a train is near.
- 📺 **Visual Alerts:** LCD displays show real-time train arrival messages.
